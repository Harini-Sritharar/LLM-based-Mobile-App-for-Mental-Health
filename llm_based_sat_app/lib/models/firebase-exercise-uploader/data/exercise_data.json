Creating an affectional bond with the child through singing jolly love songs while looking at our favourite childhood photo releases dopamine in the brain’s reward centre. This leads to hope and motivation for carrying out the self-attachment protocols. The secretion of dopamine also leads to the secretion of serotonin, oxytocin, and vasopressin, which prepare us for active loving and taking care of the child. Communicating with the child - Speaking out loud: In the process of caring for the child, it is important to communicate by speaking out loud, to create an emotional bond with them and help them towards higher levels of emotional maturity. Even though we cannot see our child, the area of our brain that relates to long-term memories can hear our voice and recognize its kind content."
