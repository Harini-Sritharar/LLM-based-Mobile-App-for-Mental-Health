The secretion of dopamine also leads to the secretion of serotonin, oxytocin, and vasopressin, which prepare us for active loving and taking care of the child. Communicating with the child - Speaking out loud: In the process of caring for the child, it is important to communicate by speaking out loud, to create an emotional bond with them and help them towards higher levels of emotional maturity.
